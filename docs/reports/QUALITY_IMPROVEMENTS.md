- 22M parameters
- General purpose

After: all-mpnet-base-v2  
- 768 dimensions
- 110M parameters

```

### Chunking Algorithm
```python
# IMPROVED: Intelligent overlap based on sentence length
overlap_sentences = []
overlap_length = 0
for sent in reversed(current_chunk):
    sent_len = len(sent) + 1
    if overlap_length + sent_len <= self.chunk_overlap:
        overlap_sentences.insert(0, sent)
        overlap_length += sent_len
    else:
        break
```

### Sentence Splitting
```python
# IMPROVED: Handle legal abbreviations
text = re.sub(r'\b(Art|No|e\.g|i\.e)\.\s', r'\1PLACEHOLDER ', text)
sentences = re.split(r'(?<=[.!?])\s+(?=[A-Z(])', text)
sentences = [s.replace('PLACEHOLDER', '.') for s in sentences]
```

### Enhanced Prompts
```yaml
system_prompt: |
  You are an expert GDPR compliance advisor with comprehensive 
  knowledge of EU data protection law.
  
  Guidelines for your responses:
